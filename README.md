Interactive Library CLI
This project is a console-based interactive program that simulates a simple library system. The user can type commands to interact with the system, such as displaying help, listing books, adding new entries, or exiting the program. Commands are managed through a map of strings to functions, and the program reads data from text files for reference or help content.
